## Space travel Challenge

You are task to build a program for the space academy and it has to be bug free, scalable, future proofed and resilient.

As a space cadet engineer you need to build the logic behind space travel for various life forms (not just for the human race)

### Design and implement the following

* The federation has 4 space shuttles deployed for space travel
* Each space shuttle is able to bring 20 life forms OR maximum load of 4000kg
* Passenger can call a shuttle whenever they need to travel from and to a planet via the space dock
* There are 5 known planets to travel to at this stage namely: Angel 1 (closest), Boreth, Aurelia, Blue Horizon, Argus X (farthest)

#### Requirements

##### Front end

* every planet to have its own space dock where a passenger selects which planet to go to
* space shuttles use a lot of liquid oxygen and hydrogen for fuel. As such, it is best to have the "smarts" to be efficient when picking up passengers
* UI to illustrate how the passenger pickup and shuttle system works. (no need animation)

##### Back end

* persist travel data history via api. This will help the team to study most traveled planets and deploy more shuttles in the future
* running the server should be easy (no need for complex database systems)
